# ViewComponent
This ViewComponent outlines how to create a sliding menu that allows you to configure IP settings for connecting to an external machine (although it will not actually connect). It will also display the current network information for the phone as well, for troubleshooting purposes.

## Features
### Server
* It will ensure that only proper IP addresses can be input for each field.
* It will provide a connect button on the bottom of the screen.
